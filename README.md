Rewrite under python 3.7, should be good for all python 3.x version

The initial version is supposed to be deliberately messed with wrong parameters and settings

Use the same idea but reconstruct the code, and fix several incorrect parameters

Need to configure audio system with Stereo Mix (Windows) to get loopback sound for listening to the fishing splash using pyAudio

Need to tune the image matching threshold and audio RMS threshold for better hit rate

Need to mute Ambience, Dialog, Music, Only leave Sound at the max level in Game Sound Settings

Best pratice to run several screenshots first to crop your own templates of fishing float to get nearly 100% image match
